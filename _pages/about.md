# 💻 About Me
I am Wenxiao Zhao, a second-year Master's student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science, University of California Los Angeles, advised by [Prof. Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). I received my B.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2024, advised by [Prof. Baoxiang Wang](https://bxiangwang.github.io/).

My research interests lie in large language models, reinforcement learning, and robotics.

<p>
  I'm eager to collaborate on exciting research or projects. Please feel free to contact me at 
  <a href="mailto:wenxiao0367@ucla.edu" style="text-decoration: underline;">wenxiao0367@ucla.edu</a> if you're interested.

  We collect a dataset named MATE, which consists of 1 million chess positions with candidate moves annotated by chess experts for strategy and tactics. We finetune the LLaMA-3-8B model and compare it against state-of-the-art commercial         language models in the task of selecting better chess moves. Our experiments show that our models perform better than GPT, Claude, and Gemini models. We find that language explanations can enhance the reasoning capability of large language    models.
